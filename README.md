# NeuroFocus AI – ADHD-Friendly Focus Companion

## Overview
NeuroFocus AI is a specialized productivity tool designed to help users with ADHD and attention difficulties maintain focus, break down overwhelming tasks, and engage in active learning. Built with Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash API, it provides intelligent coaching, context-aware practice problems, and creative outlets to manage dopamine levels effectively.

## How Helpful Is This App?

NeuroFocus AI addresses common executive function challenges:

*   **Combats Task Paralysis**: By using the "Break Down Goal" feature, users can overcome the anxiety of starting large projects by turning them into manageable 5-20 minute micro-steps.
*   **Maintains Cognitive Engagement**: Unlike standard timers, the "Smart Context" practice panel generates relevant questions and problems related to the user's current task. This keeps the brain active and interested, preventing boredom-induced drifting.
*   **Reduces Shame Spirals**: The "I got distracted" feature provides non-judgmental, compassionate coaching. Instead of feeling guilty for losing focus, users get a gentle, dopamine-friendly nudge to restart.
*   **Visual Rewards**: Immediate feedback through celebrations and stats tracking helps build positive reinforcement loops.
*   **Controlled Breaks**: The "Creative Studio" offers a safe space for a creative dopamine hit (image editing) without the risk of doom-scrolling on social media.

## How to Use (Step-by-Step)

### 1. Start a Session
1.  **Enter Goal**: Type your current task into the main input field (e.g., "Study React Hooks") or use the **Microphone** icon to dictate it.
2.  **Select Mode**: Choose a context like "Study", "Coding", or "Writing" to tailor the AI's responses.
3.  **Set Duration**: Click a preset (15m, 25m, 45m) or type a custom number of minutes in the input box.
4.  **Launch**: Click **"Start Focus Session"** to begin the timer.

### 2. Overcoming Overwhelm
1.  If a goal feels too big, click **"Break Down Goal"** instead of starting immediately.
2.  Review the AI-generated list of micro-tasks.
3.  Click on a specific step (e.g., "Read introduction - 10 min") to automatically start a session for just that item.

### 3. During the Session
*   **Timer**: The large countdown keeps you anchored to the present moment.
*   **Distraction Help**: If you lose focus, click **"I got distracted"**. The AI Coach will give you a supportive message and a tiny next step to get back on track.
*   **Practice Panel**: On the right side, click "Generate Problem" to get a quiz question or coding challenge related to your specific goal. This promotes active recall.

### 4. Finishing Up
*   **Completion**: When the timer ends, celebrate with the confetti animation!
*   **Stats**: Your focus minutes, session count, and streak are automatically saved to your daily stats on the Home screen.
*   **Stopping Early**: If you need to stop, click "Finish Early". The app will credit you for the minutes you actually worked.

### 5. Creative Studio (Brain Break)
1.  Click the **"Creative Studio"** button on the Home screen.
2.  Upload an image.
3.  Type a prompt (e.g., "Turn this into a pixel art style").
4.  Let Gemini edit the image for a fun, creative break before your next session.
